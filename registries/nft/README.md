## ðŸ§° Interaction guide

As a developer that is looking to integrate DAB into an app/UI, your main point of interaction should be to use the [DAB-js library](https://github.com/psychedelic/dab-js), that also provides a standard wrapper to faciliate the integration to NFTs that use different standards. You can [read our documentation](https://docs.dab.ooo) to get detailed examples on how to do so.

This interaction guide is **not end-user oriented**, and focuses on reviewing all the exposed methods of this canister, usable in DFX, which the DAB team initially will use to maintain the canister and add new registries.

**This canister currently has four methods:**

- name: returns the name of the NFT registry canister for health check purposes
- add: adds a new canister to the registry
- remove: removes a canister that has been added to the registry before
- get_all: returns a vector of all the canisters in the registry with their information

You can call these methods using DFX. Let's add a new canister to the registry:

```sh
$ dfx canister call nft name
("NFT Registry Canister")

$ dfx canister call nft add "(record {principal_id= principal \"principalAddress\"; name= \"ICPunks\"; standard= \"icpunks\"})"
("Operation was successful")

$ dfx canister call nft get_all
(
  vec {
    record {
      name = "xtc";
      principal_id = principal "aanaa-xaaaa-aaaah-aaeiq-cai";
      standard = "icpunks";
    };
  },
)

$ dfx canister call nft remove "(\"ICPunks\")"
("Operation was successful")

$ dfx canister call nft get_all
(vec {})
```
