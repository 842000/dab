# Interaction Guide

Interacting with the address book canister and the methods it offers is a fairly easy and efficient process. Currently the private address book canister offers its users a private address book for storing different principal IDs and the names associated with them. You can find all of the methods and their usage in the
shell script located [here](https://github.com/Psychedelic/dab/blob/main/scripts/address-tests.sh).

## Private Address Book Methods

The address book canister has four methods:

| Method Name      | Description                                                                                                  |
| -----------      | -----------                                                                                                  |
| name             | Returns the name of the cansiter.                                                                            |
| get_all          | Returns all of the addresses from the address book.                             |
| remove_address   | Removes the address associated with the canister name from the address book. Returns `Ok(())` if successful. |
| add              | Adds a new address to the registry and returns `Ok(())` if the call is successful.                           |

### How to use them?

First, we add a new address to our private address book with the `add` method. The address book currently supports 3 types of adresses: Principal, Account and ICNS

Storing a contact by its principal id:
```bash
$ dfx canister call address add "(record { name= \"XTC\"; description= opt \"Dank's ledger\"; emoji= opt \"üöÄ\"; value= variant { PrincipalId = principal \"aanaa-xaaaa-aaaah-aaeiq-cai\"}}}"
(variant { Ok = null })
```

Storing a contact by its account id:
```bash
$ dfx canister call address add "(record { name= \"bob\"; description= opt \"Dank's ledger\"; emoji= opt \"üöÄ\"; value= variant { AccountId = \"b0159acc9c8b087a06fbcaee4954e010c5edabaf306e30c0578a763a0e14e020\"}}}"
(variant { Ok = null })
```


Storing a contact by its ICNS name:
```bash
$ dfx canister call address add "(record { name= \"nico\"; description= opt \"Dank's ledger\"; emoji= opt \"üöÄ\"; value= variant { Icns = \"contact.icp\"}}}"
(variant { Ok = null })
```
Saving a contact by its ICNS name also tests if the provided name actually resolves to an ICNS registered record.

Now we can use the `get_all` method and ask the canister to return all of the addresses that are associated with our principal id:

```bash
$ dfx canister call address get_all
(
  vec {
    record {
      value = variant { PrincipalId = principal "aanaa-xaaaa-aaaah-aaeiq-cai" };
      name = "XTC";
      description = opt "Dank's ledger";
      emoji = opt "üöÄ";
    };
    record {
      value = variant {
        AccountId = "b0159acc9c8b087a06fbcaee4954e010c5edabaf306e30c0578a763a0e14e020"
      };
      name = "bob";
      description = opt "description";
      emoji = opt "üëç";
    };
    record {
      value = variant { Icns = "nico.icp" };
      name = "nico";
      description = opt "description";
      emoji = opt "üëç";
    };
  },
)

```

Okay, but since this canister is not deployed to the mainnet yet, we should remove it from the address book. To remove an address we use the `remove` method:

```bash
$ dfx canister call address remove "(\"XTC\")"
(variant { Ok = null })
```

Voil√†! We have used `add`, `remove`, and `get_all`! And since the `name` method only returns the name of the canister and doesn't actually do an operation, we are not going to call it here.
