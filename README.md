# Dfinity Address Book (Dab)

## Overview

The Dfinity Address Book (also known as the Dab) is a decentralized application and canister based on the Internet Computer.

What Dab does is not much different from a classic phone book. With either, you can look up for different addresses and the names associated with them. Dab acts as a phone book for canisters based on the Internet Computer. Each canister has a name and a principal ID, it is Dabâ€™s responsibility to store them and return the ID when a call is made for the name.

For storing the information, Big Map is used. Big Map is a very minimalistic insert/update only auto-scalable key-value storage for the I.C.
