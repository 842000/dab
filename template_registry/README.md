# ðŸ“¦ Template Registry Canister

The Template Registry is an example implementation of the DAB Registry Standard interface, written in Rust. We hope that this example implementation acts as an aid for developers implementing their own registries. 

> *REMEMBER: Your candid interface must at least contain **everything** included in the [DAB Registry Standard candid interface](https://github.com/Psychedelic/dab/blob/main/candid/standard.did).*

If you have any questions or queries while creating your registry, don't hesistate to reach out to us by [joining our Discord](https://discord.gg/yVEcEzmrgm).
